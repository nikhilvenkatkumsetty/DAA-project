In this project, we have implemented two algorithms to solve different facets of the Maximum Weight Matching(MWM) problem.


1) Edmonds' Blossom Algorithm, which solves the Maximum Cardinality Matching(MCM) problem, which is a special case of MWM problem.
 
2) Drake - Hougardy's Approximation Algorithm which provides a good approximation to the exact solution to the MWM probem.


The project has been tested to work in the Ubuntu Operating System . Please run this project in a Linux environment.


The code files are in the /src sub-folder, which also contains a Makefile. Detailed instructions to run those files are mentioned there. The references used for this
project have also been added in the eponymous sub - folder.

This project was implemented as part of the IT303 Design and Analysis of Algorithms course. Please find the video explaining the project and the PPT used in their
respective sub - folders.
